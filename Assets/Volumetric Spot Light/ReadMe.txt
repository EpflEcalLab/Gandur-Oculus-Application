This package offers an efficient and practical way to render volumetric spot light.
Available on mobile platform !

How to setup ?
  1. Create a GameObject with empty Mesh Filter component in your scene, this will be the volumetric spot light object.
  2. Attach script "Taper.cs" to the GameObject, it will generate taper mesh vertex data.
  3. Attach material "Volumetric Spot Light.mat" to the taper GameObject, make it volumetric appearance.
  4. Add a unity buildin spot light to scene, align with the volumetric taper so make other things be lighten by our volumetric spot light.
  5. Group unity buildin spot light and volumetric spot taper together into a gameobject as parent, attach script "VolSpotLit.cs".

There are many parameters in "Taper.cs" and "VolSpotLit.cs", adjust them as you need.
